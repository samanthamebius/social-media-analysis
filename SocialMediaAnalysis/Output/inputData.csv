"I am laughing way too hard at this.

Just picturing him coming and going jump scaring by yelling Snips at her from around corners."
The show becomes a Paranoia thriller for Ahsoka
I honestly kinda like the idea.
"Tbh, its what I wanted the obi-wan show to be"
Anakin jump scares!
"This is where the fun begins XD.

Seriously though, Obi Wan yelling at the air could start the crazy Ben rumors that Luke talks about in A New Hope."
"""I said Cato Neimoidia doesn't count!""

""There's Old Ben again."""
Tuskens: (These settlers are getting worse all the time!)
"If you watch the Not Obi-wan channel on YouTube, itís Obi, force ghost Qui-gonn, and Anakin watching Star Wars stuff"
Such a good channel
"One of my favorite channels is ""The Farce Awakens""! They have parodies of the sequel trilogy characters, including Rey, Finn, Poe, Leia, Ben/Kylo, Han, Luke, Hux, and Phasma."
"This is exactly what I predicted/wanted too. I donít hate what they did, but I wish we got more PTSD Obi-Wan memories/visions/nightmares vs full on adventure."
"Completely agree. If Obi-Wan got the Samurai Jack Season 5 treatment, we would have a better show overall"
If Disney wasnít the owner of Star Wars we wouldíve gotten a better show overallÖ
"It wouldíve been good if people gave Solo a chance. Kenobi was a movie originally but because people didnít give Solo a chance without Ford despite it being a decent movie, they decided to scrap the movie idea"
That show was bafflingly mishandled.
"Force Ghost Qui-Gon, aka ""The Phantom Menace"""
but Vader hadn't died yet
Iím still mad you lied to get on the Citadel mission Snips. Donít make me get Ploís ghost and talk it out
I can imagine him being petty by knocking stuff off shelves with the force
Catakin Shelfwalker
"Ahsoka: ANAKIN NO!

The Chosen One: I am inevitable knocks over item"
That cup. That cup is the chosen one.
The force is a pathway to many abilities considered to be unnatural
takes out a spray bottle and squirts water at Anakin
sand would work better
Pocket sand!
Captain howdy actually
I would give a lot to see Ploís ghost. Except he didnít die. #PloEscapedAtTheLastMinute
I'm still impressed at Filoni's restraint. He didn't add a plot to have Plo learn Force Ghostification from Qui-gon or something.
ìIs that what this is about?î
"I was hoping Episode 9 would be Force Ghost Luke haunting Kylo while Kylo goes about his day. ""What you doing there, sport? Putting your helmet back together? Good for you, kid"""
"""You're my nephew but you'll always be a little shit Ben."""
"I would've been happy with what the novelization did, which was essentially Force Ghost Luke haunting Leia, poking at her, teasing her.

In the book, she knew that her time was approaching, and Luke was goading her into stubbornly refusing to let go until she reignited the light in her son. It was fun and sweet."
"Honestly I would have watched it. Ghost Anakin just...Being around, but only in Ashoka's PoV scenes would have been a good build up to their final scene together as well."
Sabine thinking she's losing her sanity half the time would be hilarious
No new footage though. Just him smiling the way he did on Endor
If they leaned into it really hard then yeah. Just scenes of Ahsoka doing normal day-to-day things and Anakins ghost just standing next to her the whole time making passive aggressive comments the whole time. Iíd watch that
"Baylon kicking her butt. Anakin: goodness, Snips, have you learned nothing???"
That but dialed up to 11. Anakin has taken on the mannerisms of Micheal Scott
"I'm getting serious robot chicken ""force ghost jar jar"" vibes"
Just watch that guy doing deepfakes of Anakin and Obi-wan reacting to Ahsoka thats basically what it is
and qui gon
Of course cannot forget that hungry ghost boy
"lmao yeah, also I watched one of the episodes of them reacting and obiwan had to drug qui to not let him see anakin being vader ??"
Classic I could watch them go for hours (and have) it's just fun
They should make an Anakin series with more clone wars adventures
"3 years of war and 365 days in a year, we can definitely cram in some extra stories"
I always feel like it is implied to take longer on screen than what the books state.
"Just like breaking plates, turning lights on and off, and opening cupboards. But heís still fully visible with a blue glow so he just looks like an asshole."
"Anakin: Yeah, I run this shindig now Snips"
Everyone around reacts with growing fear and dread about the ghost that haunts her and meanwhile she's just staring affectionately at his giggling blue-glowing form as he has the most fun he can with it
"I'd watch it. The Ahsoka/Anakin interaction was, in my opinion, absolutely excellent. I think it spoke to Ahsoka's guilt that she abandoned Anakin when she left the Jedi order, and I'd love to see an arc where Ahsoka wrestles with those feelings and what I'm sure are years of questioning what would have happened if she had stayed with Anakin, and if their Jedi/padawan bond might have kept him from becoming Vader."
"Like the little league coach whose son is the pitcher. ""Come on, Snips! HUSTLE!"""

"My theory is that Filioni keeps connecting the dots and Anakin also starts popping in on Luke and teasing him, so much so that he cut himself off from the force. ìGosh dad, I KNOW FORM 3î - Luke ìIncorrectî - Force Ghost Anakin"
"Anakin: I'm the Chosen One, I'll be here past your death kiddo"
Iím hoping Ahsoka and Sabine get back to their galaxy by Anakin guiding them through the world between worlds and they just pop out and land on Luke having breakfast. ìDamn it Dad not again!î
Anakin: Get your scrawny ass up and go help stop Thrawn
"""OOHoohOOHooh Snips the pear is floating all by itself oohOOHooh""

""I can see you Master, also we can both actually levitate things""

""And now the lights are flickering on and off ominously OOHoohOOH"""
"""I'm most certainly grumpy about this."" -Old Obi-Wan"
Ask I can think of right now is Ghost Nappa from DBZ Abridged.
"Anakin: She took the space map

Ahsoka:FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-"
"Just imagine if their were hundreds of stormtroopers charging at her and she looked over her shoulder to see Anakin and asked him ""master Skywalker there are too many of them what are we going to do!"""
Anakin: That evil Vader smile he did in Obi-Wan Kenobi
"ìAnakin, go away, I need privacy to go to the bathroom.î

ìIncorrect.î"
"She must learn to defend herself while using the toilet, Form 8: The Sitting Style."
And Form 9: The Shitting Style
Could you imagine if Ahsoka was just 8 episodes of Ezra and Ahsoka/Sabine swapping places?
Sounds like the plot of The Marvels but with Rebel characters
That sounds like something David Fincher would do
Ghost Anakin: AHSOOOOOOKAAAA! Iím haunting you.
Ahsoka about to pull a Cade Skywalker and smoke them sticks
"Ahsoka: IíM NOT CRAZY! YOUíRE CRAZY! ESPECIALLY YOU, ANAKIN!

Ghost Anakin: EeeeeyÖ!"
Who you gonna call? GHOST SKYGUY
Ahso-soka-soka! Sososososoka!
I'm imagining Ahsoka chasing Ghost Anakin around with a proton pack while Anakin taunts her
And Iím out of Ghost Nappa quotes that would work.
Got any Ghostbusters ones?
"Nah, I was basically running on Ghost Nappa bits."
"Don't you have a son you can go bother?

He's always busy besides you were always like a daughter to me

Don't you have an actual daughter!

Yeah but I kind of blew up her planet and tortured her boyfriend

Mmmm do you really think you're in the position to give me advice considering how many bad life decisions you made

We learn from our mistakes?

Really though? Like did you ever do that ever?"
"So like Hit Monkey, but Star Wars? I'd watch it."
Iíd love this tbf
I'd love a show like that. Even had an idea for one based around a similar concept.
We need the dark Anakin story ????
Watch: Episode 3
Basically v and Johnny silverhand
"Ahsoka walks near tree.

Anikan: BOO! Gotcha snips!

Ahsoka walks down hallway approaches corner.

Anikan: BOO! Gotcha snips!

Ahsoka enters her ship

Anikan: BOO! Gotcha snips!

Ahsoka is taking a dump.

Anikan: BOO! Gotcha snips!

Best comedy in star wars history."
"Anakin: Obi-Wan, hey Obi-Wan! Watch this!

Obi-Wan: Again? Shouldn't you be helping your kids rebuild the galaxy?

Anakin: They've got that handled, this'll be hilarious! Come on!"
And now the hunt truly begins
Just Ahsoka running from nobody to everyone else
This is what I expect the conversation will be.
Just loving the idea of a buddy cop style show with Ashoka and the ghost of Anakin that only she can see investigating crimes throughout the outer rim
"Columbo Skywalker: Oh, One More Thing.."
Cameo of Liam Neeson subbing in when Anakin has to leave for a ghost-Dentist appointment he booked a few months ago. He canít miss that ghost-teeth cleaning again.
He's gotta look his best
"They should do a Star Wars show called ""Force Ghosts"" just to bring all of our favorite Jedi back together for a wholesome family comedy. Luke gets frustrated trying to get those power converters, Leia tells him to try and fix the moisture vaporators, and then Yoda jumps in with....."
What an upgrade
"Not haunting, but straight trolling."
