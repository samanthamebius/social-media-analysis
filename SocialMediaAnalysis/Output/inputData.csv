Gus's last words were HAUWWWW
"Mike's last words are perfect for him. That's the only part of his death that made sense, aside from how he should have saved Kailey."
"Todd shouldnít have tried to convert Walt into Catholicism, then Jesse wouldnít have killed him"
Actually Gusí last words would be HAAAAA
Mike's go the hardest no doubt
You forgot:
"Emilio, Lydia and Jane most likely had different last words than what we see on screen. All weíre alive for hours after their final in-show lines."
Gusí last words are so ironic if you think about it
This was really interesting. Itís hard to create/find fresh content for this subreddit anymore. You did it. Props
Waltís real last words were said in that look he gave to Jesse in the finale.
Drew Sharp: damn this tarantula looking really sick!

"Wasn't Combo's last word ""Bounce?"""
Ding ding ding ding - Hector
Combos are wrong his were.. ìwhat I say? get out of here.. goî
"I want my last words to be ""I am breaking bad"" as I cause the Earth to implode"
"Marie...""well what do you think? so I was shopping the other day and the assistant says to me do you know I fancy a drink let's have a margherita so she says anyway how's Walt? I've been thinking and maybe we should have a big get together for Holly's birthday you know it's only once a year so we need a big get together ooh is that new wallpaper? so I was working the other day and blah blah blah blah you know?"""
