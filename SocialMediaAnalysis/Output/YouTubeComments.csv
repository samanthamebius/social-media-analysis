"The reaction to that blood-to-ketchup transition never fails to make me laugh "
"Hank has always been the typical ""kind but macho cop"", the protector of his family and the embodiment of masculinity to everyone around, like Walt Jr for example who loves him. And now, he is broken down, weak, can barely walk a few feet, needs his own wife to help him pee and shit... He's ashamed, doesn't know what to do with himself, and is distracting himself with his collection of minerals.

 He has never had to learn to accept being vulnerable, and he is much more vulnerable now than the average person ever is in their lifetime. He hates that Marie sees him like this, and he would have much preferred staying in the hospital eating shitty food and being surrounded by strangers than to receive support from Marie when just her presence makes him feel humiliated, no matter how well-meaning she is, he hates that she sees him like this at all and he reacts aggressively because being dominant and agressive is what had always worked in his life previously when he had to handle conflicts as a cop.

People need varying degrees of solitude to process trauma or situations, but Hank cannot express it healthily so he lashes out, and Marie is too blinded by her love and desire to see him to realize it."
ìwhy is he treating her like this?î Itís exactly what you said earlier: he feels useless. Hank has been raised to believe his worth as a person is defined by his strength and independence. Having his spouse support him to this level goes against the traditional masculinity heís used to. His entire way of life has changed and he doesnít know how to deal with it in a healthy way so he takes it out on the person most connected to it all.
"I hope your weekend was very good, Breaking Bad is one of the best television series in history. I was lucky enough to see all its seasons and I enjoyed it very much. I hope you are enjoying the best series in history "
"12:37
I love the detail that even Mike got so scared that he drew his gun"
"Boy, this is a tense season, Walter and Gusís face-off is riveting as Batman versus the Joker in The Dark Knight"
I felt Skyler moved the car so that no one would have questions for her if he never showed up again. Also to avoid questions from Walt Jr.
My favorite part of these reactions is when V says ìJESSE we need to cookî
"Hank is a very prideful, alpha type dude, as shown, and for someone like him it's very difficult to show such  vulnerability. It's new to him, he feels like he should always be her King, so to speak. Not in a commanding way exactly, just a man that can take care of business. Now he can't even shit by himself and he's ashamed. Marie, bless her heart, understands because she knows him better than anyone, so....yeah."
"That scene with Gus is a classic ""Show. Don't tell"" 
Nothing he could have said would have made more of an impact on Walt.  Just like the show writers can't just say Gus is a badass and have the audience buy it."
"Congratulations on reaching the minerals arc of Breaking Bad

As for Hanks treatment of his wife, I feel like because he feels so bad about his situation, and that he is depressed about not being able to do everything himself, he feels shame and doesnít value himself, and likely doesnít feel like he is living up to what he should be for his wife, or doesnít deserve her in his current condition, and is therefore taking his resentments out on her a bit."
"I guess the gun dealer is also hesitant to sell to Walt because he can sense that he's about to do something stupid, and that he's not exactly a pro. Which could mean that he also puts the dealer in danger, in case he talks to the police after finishing the stupid thing."
"One of the advantages to watching this (Any) Series unfold one episode per week?  It gave us the chance to process everything that happened, BEFORE the next episode added to it!  That, and the anticipation for the next episode/Season?  I can't imagine binge watching this Series (The first time you see it).  That would cause ALL my internal emotional circuit breakers to FLIP!   Lovin' your reactions to this!  Well done, and 'Thank you!'"
Mike is such a good character he may not always have all the chess pieces in play but he does know all the moves.  It helps keep him alive in this criminal world.
"You have to go through the bitter to get to the sweet. This show is worth the horrors.  Please stick with it.  We are all watching with you.  And yes, the transition from ""blood"" to ""ketchup"" was brilliant."
"as some have said, when Hank sees Marie around, he feels useless, emasculated, embarrassed ,etc in front of the person he feels he was meant to protect and be a rock for, so he pushes her away so he doesn't have to feel that. And he focuses on the minerals to distract himself from life."
"my opinion of Mike is heís honestly a person with a good heart and someone who keeps it 100% real with everyone. heís not gonna sugar coat anything, heís gonna tell you exactly what the situation is and your options. sometimes being real can be mistaken for kindness and make you think theyíre on your side but really he was just keeping it real."
"I missed your BB reactions so much, I've been waiting for it! P.S. Love the new hairstyle"
"Hank is avoiding addressing his problems, just like Jesse. Jesse is desperately trying to keep himself occupied so that he doesn't have to think about murdering Gale, and Hank is as injured emotionally as he is physically but can't handle or express that pain in a healthy way."

I‚Äôm just imagining years later Ken turning on a news report and recognizing Walt as the guy he cut off and Saul as the guy who scammed him‚Ä¶
Season 1 is so relaxed it feels like Malcolm in the middle compared to the later seasons when things get dark
Still wondering how Walt got away with this. No cameras or nearby witnesses?
This was the moment walter became an arsonist
By far one of my favorite scenes in BB. So glad they brought Ken back in BCS
Ken returning in BCS was such a legendary decision to see him get owned again.
‚ÄúCall the fire people!‚Äù Gets me everytime
That was the exact moment when Ken's car exploded. Bravo Vince
"I gotta say, this is the moment I stopped rooting for Walter White. To bully a successful businessman like this, it's disgraceful!"
From a meta perspective this IS the moment because this is the point where the writers decided to make Walter a bad guy in denial
Yeah Walt can be scary nuts and unpredictable even by Tuco or Lalo's standards! A real 100% certified psycho.
How did no one catch Walt for this?
"I really like this scene, when Walt blows up Ken‚Äôs car, it symbolizes how he hates him"
Love this scene.
A melhor s√©rie que j√° assisti. Top de linha.
This is the moment where Ken Wins became Ken Loses
"This is the moment we see Walter is the protagonist,no camera or witness and somehow ken didnt see him walking away from the car."
"I'm addicted to Bryan Cranston. My Son watched Malcolm in the Middle...I was too busy doing work, college everything a single Mom dies, plus Lois irritated me...I watch every episode on hulu. Lois is infamous and Bryan is genius. I thought he was a nerd but the actor he is made it so real. Love Bryan. Gonna do Breaking Bad agai. 4th time. Maybe even Your Honor too..."
Poor Ken. First he has to pay around a thousand dollars for a bottle of tequila for Kim and Jimmy and then Walt blows up his car.
He should have also had an El Camino cameo where Jesse ran him over or something
