"Great video. Also worth mentioning how long security/software updates are provided for each model. ie. 15 models will receive iOS updates for roughly 2 years longer than 13 models. Given the price of devices, this is relevant to those not upgrading regularly/continuously."
"Iíve got the iPhone 13 mini  512GB
I really love the form factor for itís one-handed usability and itís pocketability.
The screen isnít that small at all"
"Why shouldn't we consider 14 over 13. Since the repair cost has drastically decreased for back panels. When You pay extra $100 or   INR 7-8k in India. Can you tell. It would be an upgrade from iphone 11? Thanks .Moreover phone will be for my mother and she doesn't change phones before 3 years at least.

Can you make similar videos for Samsung S22 series vs S23 series in total. There is black friday sale coming in India."
"Trying to decide if I should keep plugging along in my 11 pro max,  it's just had a new screen put on but the battery is stuck on 80% for over a year.  Honestly if they warranty the battery I'll likely just keep it.  Pixel 7 and 8 look like great devices too."
You can also consider a 13 pro in the refurbished or resale market you can easily get hold of one for 500-700$
Currently using a 4 year old android flagship back in the day and thinking of switching to ios. Do you think that iphone 14 pro is worth getting than the 15 pro? It is about 200 usd cheaper in my country. The only thing that keeps me away from 14 pro is the battery degradation issue. Thoughts?
Another great video.  Very helpful advice.  Well done
I love my iPhone 13. It was free for changing my number. Only downside Iím stuck in a 3 year contract
Love my 13. Iím picky. I will most definitely upgrade when that 16pro drops tho!

Hey Pete I'm planning to buy my very first iPhone but I'm torn between the 14 Pro or 13 Pro Max because in my place there price is not that big of a difference
"I really appreciate this video, I have been thinking of getting the 15 pro max, but I already have the 14 pro max, made me realize, I dont really need an upgrade right now. But I might consider getting an android phone though hehe. which one do you recommend?"
"Chip: 13
Chip and big: 14 Plus
Not chip: 15
Not chip big: 15 Plus
Pro is only sense when you use phone camera to work - then 15 Pro or Pro Max basic capacity since you can use external disc to record movies."
I'm upgrading from a galaxy A03s to a 13. never been more excited
I really thought this years normal iPhone 15 would have also got the 100hz refresh rate on the screen or 120hz not sure what it is
I have no idea which iPhone to upgrade to. I'm currently on the 7 Plus and I like it but its about time I upgraded. I don't know which iPhone to pick up but I don't have quite the budget to get any of the pro models
"Hi Pete, Iíve got the iPhone 11 Pro and I really need an upgrade with the battery life and shattered back. I do like the iPhone 15 but is it worth the buck? I do Like the usbc and the dynamic island. My choices are the iPhone 13 or iPhone 15."
Iím loving my 15 Pro. The 15 Pro Max is too big for me.
"Hee this video was very helpful but Iím still doubting wether to choose the iPhone 13/14/15, I currently have a really slow iPhone 8 and I would like an update"

Pro tip you can hold the RAW MAX button to change the mode without swapping to the settings app
It's great to rewatch the intro to this review having just watched the behind-the-scenes filming video of the intro by The Studio! High-end production work for a high-end product! Great work by the entire team!
OH MY GOD that intro! This is one of the few channels that consistently makes me re-watch a scene to appreciate the amazing cinematography / animation. Absolutely incredible!
Consistently the best intros and reviews in the game. The level of production quality is miles ahead of any other tech channel for that matter.
"The intro scenes are incredible quality. It started playing and I actually had to pause, go back to the beginning of the sequence, and rewatch it. So good. Great video Marques!!"
"Would be great if they include ""gestures"" for the action button with a firmware update. Eg. single tap, double tap, triple tap, long hold, etc."
"I'm not here for Apple, I'm here for MKBHD's opinion"
You guys killed it with this video!I love the creative colab of your team.Its always fun to watch.
I‚Äôve been watching MKBHD since I was a 7th grader back in 2013. 10 years later and it‚Äôs just gotten better. Best tech reviewer in history
"Thanks for sharing the results of your tests. They‚Äôre very insightful and interesting, especially for people like us who can‚Äôt afford multiple phones to perform comparisons."
The intro gave me crazy goosebumps!! Kudos to the team for the amazing work here
"As someone who prioritises video quality over all other features on a new phone, I'm blown away by the quality I'm getting from my iPhone 15 Pro Max. I also don't see many people talking about the action mode when paired with the 5x zoom - it creates some insane parallax shots that are near impossible with my pro cameras."
I appreciate the fact that the MKBHD team doesn‚Äôt rush to be the first to put out content. And when they actually DO‚Ä¶it‚Äôs both quantity AND quality. Keep it up guys!
I just love to watch MK's presentation and review of stuff.  Its so natural and convective to learning.  Keep up the good work MK.
"I‚Äôm that iPhone user that sees what he‚Äôs mentioning about minute changes and those are the reasons I‚Äôve gotten the new phone - not to mention feeling better in hand, better response from the keyboard and more things like this‚Ä¶to some it may ‚Äúnot be worth it‚Äù but I feel it‚Äôs definitely worth the upgrade. And that‚Äôs having came from the 14 Pro Max. Thanks for the review and the input, MKBHD!"
Definitely staying with Zen 10. I haven't felt like upgrading my iPhone since the 13pro. I decided to give it a shot to Zen 10 and I'm loving it.
"My experience with the 24MP photos is a lot more positive than what you are saying. They way WAY sharper than a 12 MP photo and this is especially noticable when taking photos of anything with a lot of fine detail such as hair, fur, tree leaves, grass, gravel etc etc. It is a huge improvement to mobile phone photography and all while only using 50% more space. I have also taken some phenomenal photos with the 48 MP HEIF mode. I have owned a few phones that had high res sensors (Note 20 Ultra, Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra, S22 Ultra) and taken photos using the full 108MP or 50MP mode but none of them compared to the ridiculous clarity that I am getting with the 48MP HEIF mode. I was taking photos of my cat sunbathing in the window yesterday on 48MP HEIF and god damn, the detail in the fur, it's crazy. The Xiaomi was close in quality/detail but the 108MP sensor on the Note 20 Ultra and S22 Ultra just isn't even close in both detail and colour. Just goes to show that resolution is important but just because one number is higher, doesn't necessarily mean it's better. I don't have an S23U to compare with and I am sure that is very good too. Would be good to see some comparisons. Close up animal photos are a good way to compare these high res modes because of the amount of detail in the fur, eyes etc."
"it'd be really cool if they add this to Android (specifically Pixel), but make it better by adding the following:
- double click
- double click and hold.

This lets you have THREE functionalities for one button. I already use double click to launch camera on my Pixel, but having more buttons would be great.

I want to be able to launch the following:
- payment
- flashlight
- voice recording
- Nike Run"
I love how Marques always takes his time and thoroughly tests products before releasing his reviews.
"Moving from the iPhone 13 Pro Max to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, it‚Äôs a substantial increase in comfortability for me. Plus, I get a couple new features like dynamic island. Worthwhile upgrade, though, I could‚Äôve continued for a couple more years on my previous phone without too much trouble. Well, outside of the battery being at 82% health already. That was concerning."

Always a vibe watching people changing their phones every year while my phone is growing with me
"From simple tech videos to recognized by the largest tech company, mkbhd has seen unprecedented progress. Congrats Marques!"
"I understood why I like Marques' videos so much - they are so calm (and professional and to the point and good visuals of course)
No over the top nonsence, just pure level and vision; well done and keep up!"
In the full review I would love to see some side by side comparisons between this year's iPhone 15 model and last year's iPhone 14 pro models. I think there's a great discussion to be had there since the prices are actually really close to each other and I'm wondering what the tradeoff is between the two!
Love that new simple packaging design to peel off the two tabs
Would love to see a comparison of the 3x lens photos quality between iPhone 15 Pro Max vs iPhone 15 Pro / 14 Pro / 13 Pro since the 15 Pro Max doesn‚Äôt have it anymore. I‚Äôm still using my iPhone 13 Pro using and loving the 3x camera the most. Currently I am not planning to upgrade since the 13 Pro is still almost perfect
I personally think that the action button would be more versatile if I could also customize the shortcuts on the Lock Screen. I could see the action button being interesting as a camera function if I could change that button on the Lock Screen to some other toggle
"It would be nice to see you battery testing these against Apple‚Äôs previous flagship phones especially the ones that lasted the longest. MWTB did a video on it and since both y‚Äôall have every phone, it should be interesting to see similar results."
"I'd love to see how the pro and regular phones handle content consumption. If there's any changes or glitches and old cases fit in the new ones. The coloured glass seems really washed out in other videos. Also, how is the charging with the new braided cables? Which iPhone would be best for people who are heavy users but don't shoot video content."
It would be great if the new Action button could have focus dependent actions. Example: Be a flashlight trigger during Sleep Focus and open Notes during Work Focus
"I think it would be cool to see a ‚Äúis it worth upgrading‚Äù type video. Where you compare the 15/15pro against previous generations of iPhone to see how many improvements have been made. I feel like a lot of people I know are hanging on to their iPhones longer nowadays, especially given how long they support their older devices. I myself am still rocking my 11 Pro Max in Midnight Green"
Action button assigned to Shortcuts + the accessibility double tap and triple tap on the back of the phone to do other actions will be pretty sweet.  I‚Äôve had screenshot assigned to triple tap for a while now and that works out pretty well.
Would love to see a camera comparison between the 14 series and 15 series that goes over the issues with the 14's software engine and if there are any updates
MKBHd - I‚Äôm always curious about how does the video of pro version perform in low light situations especially the wide screen. How does it compare with iPhone 13 or 14 because that‚Äôs what we have and right now we always thought that the normal zoom is better than the wide and the 2.5x zoom. Is it any better now? Hope to see this in your full review.
"Would love to see the camera capabilities with each lens, both handheld and on a tripod."
Adding double press to the new button would probably be slightly worse because it would require a delay every time you click to give you time to do the second click. I think I prefer how instant the button is right now.
"I've never really been an iPhone guy. I've owned and used a 5s and SE2, but the baseline 15 may be my next purchase. I'm currently on a 6a and I can't get over how big it feels. One thing the (standard non-plus/max) iPhones do right is feel smaller than they are, and the upside with the 15 is that it actually is psychically slightly smaller than the Pixel 6a while having the same size screen. That plus carrying over the 14 Pro's chip and camera make it a heck of a deal. I'm just not sure about these colors. I'm still waiting for word on an SE4/mini, but the 15 is looking pretty good."
"Great video. Straight to the point and no nonsense. 

I would love a ‚ÄúIs it worth upgrading‚Äù segment where you‚Äôd advice certain xs, xs max, 11, etc. users whether is it worth the hefty amount to upgrade."
"Thank you man for video!! I already got the iPhone 15 plus and I‚Äôd be interested in knowing if it‚Äôs truly better than the 14s and 15 base models. Can you do a video about the differences between 14 pro max and 15s? I‚Äôd really appreciate it!! "
I‚Äôd love to see your take on how the pro max has become the ‚Äúpro pro‚Äù while the 15 pro is left out certain features. Each time I have felt compelled to get the max because otherwise I‚Äôm leaving better features on the table when I would much rather have a phone that actually fits in my hand. There‚Äôs a reason I have an iPad. Maybe they could put a really awesome camera and those cool features that need a larger form factor in the iPad?
