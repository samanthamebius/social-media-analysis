Dang No-Doze just disrespect Tuco in front of Walter White and Jesse and got beated to death
Tuco was actually pretty cool when he wasn’t tweaked out. As soon as he snorted he became an animal
"I counted twenty punches here, all to the face, that's quite a beating, in Cobra Kai when Hawk gives the bully guy a legendary beating there's a total of fifteen hits to the face in that, so that bully got 75% of a fatal beating if you compare the numbers"

Have met a few guys with tucos personality. They are very interesting individuals.
Anyone else here bc @1minutetalkshow
"‘Just remember who you are working for’

when the drugs kick in
This is how my mom reacts when ppl tell her to relax.
this was the moment Heisenberg became Walter White.
"I think Tuco is actually a pretty reasonable guy





Just show him his due respect and you'll get along swimmingly xD"

"0:44 you can see the subtle uncertainty in Walters face, he does not want this, he is not fit for this, Heisenberg is only pretending to be into this, he does not like what is happening, he wants to leave, he is a good person in the wrong place, all this from less than a second of a reaction. Wow"
"Tuco, Tuco…"
Can we all agree Tuco never had any brains his whole time on the show?
"In the late 80's, Raymond Cruz (Tuco) was in an educational video, about the dangers of (ironically) drug use. It followed three separate kids who had died, and existed only as spirits, who narrate each other's stories of how who got involved with drugs, and how it ultimately killed each of them in the end. Cruz played the first kid, a high school senior who smoked marijuana and drank beer, and then went joyriding while under the influence of both. I think you can guess how he died."
"Tuco's ""Tight Tight Tight!"" makes me remind of the commercial of PopCorners, I wonder which is original."
Dude looks so innocent
Tuco is like a timed bomb but you can't see the timer and it can explode in anytime
Walt is not a badass. His ego is so overinflated. He was crying praying to god mike didn’t kill him. But as soon as he knew they couldn’t kill him he went straight back to Heisenberg.
"He almost got the:

 lets go waltuh  BOOM* shot on the back of the head"
"That ""Yeahh""
Goddd i love it"
"Mike should have called Gus, for him to then call Gale to get out of the house."
4:05 the moment Mike met Heisenberg.
"The real cunning of Walter was in his ability to manipulate Mike into thinking he was terrified for his life. In reality, Walter was never scared. It was just a ploy to convince Mike that Walt was desperate enough to give up Jesse to save himself. The second Jesse was on his way to Gale, all traces of fear left Walter's face and voice, even with Mike's gun trained right on him, as if he was in control the enrire time. The dude was cold-blooded."
Walt's a pretty damn good actor in the show lol
Watching this. Mike deserved the end he got.
"If Mike killed Walt here, he would be lying beside Howie and Lalo"
"Rās al Ghul outplays Commissioner Gordon

Only legends know"
Walter seemed to be a man that liked to keep business & home apart. He did not appear to appreciate it when he noticed a pipe when visiting Jesse. Maybe he didn´t want the line between the two worlds to become blurry..
"“Yeah unfortunately I do Walter.”

Do you? You HAVE to? You had to become a murdering psychopath? 

Mike genuinely believes he was doing what he did for his family. Walt is also a sociopath, but at the very least he admitted he liked it and that everything he did was for selfish reasons. 

Mike never does that. Mike is complex as hell, but my god does it drive me crazy how idolized he is in the BrBa community. Man was nuts."
"Walt played Mike like a fiddle here… the hunched up shoulders, the begging… then the real Walt shows up when he says, “You might wanna hold off.”"
Bryan Cranston nailed that
"4:00 : For any fans of Calebcity  ""6.. 3.. 5.. 4 BoardFish road.. Is that your address?"""
I didn’t feel bad at all when Walt killed Mike. Mike would of killed Walt here and now if it weren’t for this master play
I love that this show has the best fans. We come back to these clips and admire this genius show. Walt can go from pathetic and begging to ruthless and brillant in seconds. Walt is the most dangerous character ever to appear on the screen.
"The red light glowing in the hatch, framing Walter like he's standing at a doorway to hell."
Is there any character better than Walter in 2020 series or movie ?
awesome.
